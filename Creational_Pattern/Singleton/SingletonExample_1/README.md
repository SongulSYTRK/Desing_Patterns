# Singleton
## Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. This pattern includes a single class that is responsible for creating an object while ensuring that only a single object is created. The design pattern is used to get a single instance of a class.The goal is to provide a global access point to the created object.
## <br> The situation in which it is needed is:


## <br> 1-Multiple classes must use the same instance.


## <br> 2-There needs to be only one object for the entire application.


## <br>3 It must be guaranteed that it is only one object (unique).
